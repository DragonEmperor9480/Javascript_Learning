// // Objects in JavaScript are the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
//  These objects are quite different from JavaScript primitive data-types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol) 
//  in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

// // The shorthand syntax for object property value is very popular and widely used nowadays. 
// The code looks cleaner and easy to read. The shorthand property makes the code size smaller and simpler.
